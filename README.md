## üìÑ Introduction

This repository contains the comprehensive report and code for a numerical analysis project focused on credit card fraud detection. The study addresses the critical issue of identifying fraudulent transactions within a highly imbalanced dataset, using various machine learning methodologies.

### üìë Abstract

Credit card fraud detection poses significant challenges due to the stark imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, which can adversely affect the performance of machine learning models. To tackle this issue, techniques such as **under-sampling** and **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** were applied to balance the dataset.

Our project evaluates the effectiveness of multiple machine learning models, including:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **Bagging**
- **Boosting**

An ensemble model, combining these classifiers within a voting framework, demonstrated superior performance across various metrics:
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**
- **ROC AUC**
- **Overall Accuracy**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Computational Analysis

The computational efficiency of each model was examined, with a focus on the trade-offs between training and testing times. This analysis underscores the importance of balancing **accuracy** with **computational efficiency** to ensure the practical application of these models in real-time fraud detection scenarios.

### üîÆ Future Work

Future research directions include:
- Exploring the integration of **deep learning techniques**.
- Implementing **dynamic data sampling strategies**.
- Enhancing model resilience and scalability against evolving fraud patterns and adversarial attacks.

## üìä Results

Key performance metrics for each model and the final ensemble model are detailed in the report. Visualizations of ROC curves, confusion matrices, and other evaluation metrics are available in the notebooks.
